# LaboratoryReagentInventorySpreadsheet
I hope you find this useful.  Also if you or someone you know works in a Sunquest or HMS lab, please tell them to check out my pending test log solution – OL Monitor (http://www.olmonitor.com) .
The Problem:

Many labs without an inventory management system have issues with running out of reagents, buying too many reagents and then having to dispose excess because they expired, and keeping up with expiration dates.
Obvious solutions such as putting a sticky note on “Last box” and asking techs to notify when stock is getting low, are very frustrating when they don’t work.
My Solution:

My solution of course is to use Excel and vba macros!  This is my solution to everything but it totally works here.
